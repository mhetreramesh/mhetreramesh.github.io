Hello World!

Welcome to my new website built jekyll & hosted on [git pages](https://pages.github.com/) & I'm a fond of it so far.

Here are few things which I like most about this setup:

- Simplicity

I can use Markdown to write my blogs which is really awesome and easy. You can even create beautiful UI with it!

- Speed

Git pages are pre-rendered html pages, so no requests going back and forth for you, just html pages, which makes the website blazing fast.

- Secure

While only html pages make your site loads really fast, its also really secure, there is no backend logic & data insertion.

- Easy to deploy

Since you don't need a server or even a cloud, there is no server maintenance cost. Which also saves pennies & reduces your work load.


So far I'm loving it using. You can also go ahead learn & implement it easily.
